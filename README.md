## Introduction 📜

This project belongs to the Advanced IA Module.</br></br>

It consists of building a deep learning model for classifying lung images into three categories (COVID, NORMAL, PNEUMONIA) using a Convolutional neural network (CNN).</br>
</br>
We will have a graphical interface from which we can test different images to determine the system's relevance.

## Inputs 📥
<a name="inputs"></a>
The dataset consists of 5228 lung images in PNG format with a size of 256x256 pixels, divided into three categories:
* COVID: 1626 images
* NORMAL: 1802 images
* PNEUMONIA: 1800 images
</br>



## Libraries  💡
<a name="libraries "></a>

📌Numpy

*We used Numpy for manupliting the dimensions of the image
For more you can read the official documentation on the [Livewire website](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs).

📌Matplotlib

*We used Matplotlib for displaying the training history of the model and displaying the image itself.

For more you can read the official documentation on the [Livewire website](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs).

📌Splitfolders

*We used Splitfolders to  divide the dataset randomly into  randomly into 3 datasets: 

📁training 

📁Validation

📁testing

📌Tensorflow (Keras)

*We have utilized Keras multiple times throughout this project for various purposes.
