## Introduction ðŸ“œ

This project belongs to the Advanced IA Module.</br>

It consists of building a deep learning model for classifying lung images into three categories (COVID, NORMAL, PNEUMONIA) using a Convolutional neural network (CNN).</br> We will have a graphical interface from which we can test different images to determine the system's relevance.
